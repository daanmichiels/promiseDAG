    <p>
        The promiseDAG function makes it easier to work with JavaScript's promises.
        It is a generalization of <code>Promise.all</code> to directed acyclic graphcs (DAG's).
        The project is <a href="https://github.com/daanmichiels/promiseDAG">hosted on GitHub</a>.
        You can see it in action on the <a href="demo/">demo page</a>.
